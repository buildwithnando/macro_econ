Price Probability: The probability of an agent buying from a seller can be defined as the inverse of the price. We can normalize this probability so that it sums to 1 for all available sellers.

After calculating the probabilities, each agent will make a random choice based on those probabilities to determine from whom to buy.

Ensure that if a sellers stock is down to zero the buyer should buy the rest from another agent. 

More Specialization = Higher Efficiency: If an agent focuses on producing fewer types of goods, the agent should be more efficient at producing those goods. This means less variability in the production and higher output of the focused goods.
Less Specialization = More Variability: If an agent produces many types of goods, its production of each good should have more variability (less efficient).

agent will first try and use their own supply before buying from someone else

agent can die if they go a certain amount of days without their needs fullfilled or they surpass the max age of an agent. 

Currently all the needs are needed the at the same level, future versions, the needs should not be equal, the death condition should be more nuanced


### Interesting questions? 

Was specialization good or bad? 

### Future developement:

1. Migration of agents over 2D grid
2. Split governmend spedding into police+military, education, Infrastructure+Transportation and healthcare
3. Have trading agents to iterface with other economies. 
4. Have agents murdered and stolen from
